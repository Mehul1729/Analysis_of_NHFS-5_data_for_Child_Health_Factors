This project explores the determinants of poor health among children (under 5 years) and infants (under 6 months) in Indian districts using the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) dataset. The goal is to identify key maternal and environmental factors that influence child malnutrition indicators like underweight, stunted, wasted, and anemia percentages.

The study was conducted as part of the **DSC 325** course mini-project.
